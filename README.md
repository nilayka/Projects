# About

This repository includes my projects while I have been studying in Big Data Analytics Program at MEF University. You can reach my all term projects and assignments from my GitHub Page. If you ask me a question about projects or source codes, do not hesitate [e-mail](kamarn@mef.edu.tr) to me.

## Term 1 

The first term of the program is about to introductory courses in data analytics. 

### Applied Statistics with Utku Koc

### Data Analytics Essentials with Berk Orbay

The course is aimed to perform an end-to-end reproducible data analysis from raw data to the communication of model outputs. We introduced in basically ggplot, tidyverse, RMarkdown, dplyr, and Shiny app with R programming language. 

- The group [project](https://pjournal.github.io/mef03g-r-mut/) of the course is related to Analysis of Central Bank of Turkey interest rates. 
- You can reach the part of my final exam from [here.](Final.htm)

### Big Data Management with Serhat Cevikel

- My term project is data analysis on Baby Names at USA dataset. You can find it [here.](babynames.htm)
- You can reach my final exam and source codes from [here.]()

### Intro to Programming for Big Data (Python) with Tuna Cakar

- My term project of the course was related to Zomato Restaurants Analysis in Caddebostan and Nisantasi. You can reach my source codes from [here.](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/jupyter/user/nilayka-projects-trevoqjr/notebooks/BDA507%20-%20Term_Project_Nilay_Kamar.ipynb)

## Term 2

The second term of the program includes two modules. We learned more deep of the machine learning algorithms. The first module, also the first seven weeks of the term, includes two mandatory courses and second modules have elective courses. My preferences were Marketing Analytics and Web Analytics to be experienced machine learning on real-time data.

### Introduction to Machine Learning with Tuna Cakar

- The course objective is to teach the basic machine learning algorithms, apply them on different datasets with the end-to-end data analytics project life-cycle -preprocessing, feature selection, model developing, and model evaluation-, and interpreting them.

- My term project is related to Natural Language Processing on tweets posted on the last decades with special hashtags via using Twitter API. My works on the project have been developing. 

### Optimization and Simulation with Dicle Aslan

The course contains developing models with linear programming, integer programming, and optimization using R and Excel solver, and getting insights from these models. 

### Marketing Analytics with Ozgur Ozluk



### Web Analytics with Sercan Akkas
