# About

This repository includes my projects while I have been studying in Big Data Analytics Program at MEF University. You can reach my all term projects and assignments from my GitHub Page. If you ask me a question about projects or source codes, do not hesitate [e-mail](<mailto: kamarn@mef.edu.tr?subject=[MEF%20BDA%20Github%20Projects]>) to me.

## Term 1 

The first term of the program is about to introductory courses in data analytics. 

### Applied Statistics with Utku Koc

### Data Analytics Essentials with Berk Orbay

The course is aimed to perform an end-to-end reproducible data analysis from raw data to the communication of model outputs. We introduced in basically ggplot, tidyverse, RMarkdown, dplyr, and Shiny app with R programming language. 

- The group [project](https://pjournal.github.io/mef03g-r-mut/) of the course is related to Analysis of Central Bank of Turkey interest rates. 
- You can reach the part of my final exam from [here.](<https://nilaykamar.github.io/MEF_BDA20/Data Analytics Essentials/Final.html>)

### Big Data Management with Serhat Cevikel

In this course, we were responsible to examine how to query on RDBMS and Big data ecosystems products, design modern edition data warehouses and manage massively parallel processing data warehouse technologies on cloud platforms. We also looked at the existing technologies such as RDBMS systems, Hadoop ecosystem products (Hive, Spark, etc.) and investigate their uses. 

- My term project is data analysis on Baby Names at USA dataset. You can find it [here.](<https://nilaykamar.github.io/MEF_BDA20/Big Data Management/babynames.html>)
- You can reach my final exam and source codes from [here.](<https://nilaykamar.github.io/MEF_BDA20/Big Data Management/BDM_final_.html>)

### Intro to Programming for Big Data (Python) with Tuna Cakar

- My term project of the course was related to Zomato Restaurants Analysis in Caddebostan and Nisantasi. You can reach my source codes from [here.](<https://nilaykamar.github.io/MEF_BDA20/Intro to Programming for Big Data (Python)/Term_Project_Nilay_Kamar.html>)

## Term 2

The second term of the program includes two modules. We learned more deep of the machine learning algorithms. The first module, also the first seven weeks of the term, includes two mandatory courses and second modules have elective courses. My preferences were Marketing Analytics and Web Analytics to be experienced machine learning on real-time data.

### Introduction to Machine Learning with Tuna Cakar

- The course objective is to teach the basic machine learning algorithms, apply them on different datasets with the end-to-end data analytics project life-cycle -preprocessing, feature selection, model developing, and model evaluation-, and interpreting them.

- My term project is related to Natural Language Processing on tweets posted on the last decades with special hashtags via using Twitter API. My works on the project have been developing. 

### Optimization and Simulation with Dicle Aslan

The course contains developing models with linear programming, integer programming, and optimization using R and Excel solver, and getting insights from these models. 

### Marketing Analytics with Ozgur Ozluk



### Web Analytics with Sercan Akkas

This course provides me getting insight into the basics of analytics and optimization to explore user experience and focuses on understanding customers’ behavior by using data gathering from websites or mobile applications. We used mainly in Google Analytics tools, dimensions, metrics, and usage with the support of Google Analytics Academy online courses. 

- Google Analytics metrics of Google Merchandise Store were analyzed and reported within the group project of this course. You can reach our project from [there](<https://nilaykamar.github.io/MEF_BDA20/Web Analytics/Web_Analytics_Group_Project'20.pdf>).  

### End to End Big Data Analytics with Tuna Cakar

This course is designed to be a complement of the Capstone Project class. Over the duration of this course, it was experienced several machine learning projects on Azure platform. 

### Case Studies in Analytics

This course examines various case studies arising from different application areas. Specialists in their field shared their experiences and a brief explanation about the logic of topics in their field every week. Computer vision, NLP applications, data analytics in healthcare can be counted as a couple of topics in this course. 

### Capstone Project

In my capstone project, it is wondered whether people have been quickly forgotten an event in which had been labeled as “do not forget” in their social media posts. To collect posts, Twitter was chosen between social media platforms, topic modeling algorithms were applied on tweets which contain the keyword of “unutma” which means “do not forget” in English according to their contents. The time horizon for the proposed model was selected as January’10 – December’19 to get a wide range of topics. After interpreting results as which words are related to which event, it was evaluated whether forgotten of the given topic. As a result of the analysis, it can be indicated that Ugur Mumcu Assassination, Sivas Massacre, The Marmara Earthquake, and Gezi Park Protests have been still remembered on Twitter. You can reach my detailed explanation about it from [my medium account](<https://medium.com/@nilaykamar>).
